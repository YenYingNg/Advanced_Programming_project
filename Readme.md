The starting point for this project was an app (Hand Digit Image Recognition) developed by 
[https://github.com/Sachin-crypto/Flask_Image_Recognition](Sachin Pal).

Our web app is made using Flask framework and it predicts the cats and dogs images based on the deep learning model trained using transfer learning.
